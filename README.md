### Hey, I'm Felipe Nascimento 👋

I’m currently a software developer at MMA Internet e Sistemas Ltda and I’m learning JavaScript, Node.JS, ReactJS and React Native in the free time.

Besides that, I'm graduating in Analysis and Development of Systems at Instituto Federal da Bahia (IFBA) and I love programming.
